The game "Discovery" was created by Fabrizio Nastri with help of Pierre Cattelain and illustrations by Beno√Æt Clarys.

This implementation of the game also borrowed from the "What Could Go Wrong?" digital card game developed by Nikolas Martelaro (G:nikmart) and Wendy Ju.

The contents for the initial card deck were drawn from the Wikipedia page on the History of free and open-source software edited by Wikipedia users Gronky, Greenrd, and others.

We choose to work on the paradigm deck.
