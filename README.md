üß† Game Rules ‚Äì Discovery
The Emergence project is inspired by the card game Discovery, which explores the evolution of humanity through key innovations. Each card represents a "discovery" (e.g., Fire, Toolmaking, Agriculture), and the goal is to build a tree of discoveries by playing cards that logically depend on one another.

üîó Basic Principles
Each discovery card may have one or more prerequisites, which must already be played before the card can be placed.

Cards are grouped by era (1 to 6) and by family (e.g., Tools, Movement, Society).

A card like Fire may be required to play Cooking or Metal. Without Fire, Cooking cannot be played.

Cards without prerequisites (e.g., Gathering) are "starting cards" and can be played freely.

üÉè How to Play (Discovery Explore ‚Äì Basic Rules)
Each player starts with 5 cards in hand.

On your turn, you may place a card if all its prerequisites are already on the table.

When you place a card, you gain points:

1 point for the first card in a sequence,

2 for the second,

3 for the third, etc.

Cards can be played from:

Your hand,

The shared reserve (5 visible cards for all),

Another player's discard pile (but not your own).

If you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to play a card, you discard one and draw a new one.

The game ends when all players have emptied their hands. The player with the most points wins.

üéØ Objective
Score the most points by building long, logical sequences of discoveries.
